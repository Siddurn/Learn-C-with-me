int : Typically 4 bytes, depending on the system.
float : Typically 4 bytes.
double : Typically 8 bytes.
char: Typically 1 byte.
long int : Typically 8 bytes (may vary, but often 8 bytes on 64-bit systems).
short int : Typically 2 bytes (may vary, but often 2 bytes on most systems).

Common Format Specifiers:

%d or %i: Integer

%lf: Double
%c: Character
%s: String

<stdio.h>: This header file is necessary to use printf and scanf.
printf
Purpose: printf is used to print output to the console.
printf(format_string, variables);
Explanation:
format_string: A string that includes text and format specifiers.
variables: Variables to be printed, corresponding to the format specifiers.
scanf
Purpose: scanf is used to read input from the console.
scanf(format_string, &variables);  
format_string: A string that includes format specifiers indicating the type of input to be read.
&variables: Pointers to variables where the input values will be stored.
Use the & (address-of) operator to pass the address of the variable to scanf, except for strings where the array name itself acts as a pointer.
